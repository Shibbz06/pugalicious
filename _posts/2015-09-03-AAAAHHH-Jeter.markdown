Jeter is now 6.5 years old.. And every morning and every afternoon he gets so excited for his food! Same excitement as the first time I fed him. Dang, I wish i could be that excited about something the 8,255th time I did something. 

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
